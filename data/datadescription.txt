Data Description

UTC
Timestamp UTC seconds

Temperature[C]
Air Temperature

Humidity[%]
Air Humidity

TVOC[ppb]
otal Volatile Organic Compounds; measured in parts per billion

eCO2[ppm]
co2 equivalent concentration; calculated from different values like TVCO

Raw H2
raw molecular hydrogen; not compensated (Bias, temperature, etc.)

Raw Ethanol
raw ethanol gas

Pressure[hPa]
Air Pressure

PM1.0
particulate matter size < 1.0 µm (PM1.0). 1.0 µm < 2.5 µm (PM2.5)

PM2.5
particulate matter size < 1.0 µm (PM1.0). 1.0 µm < 2.5 µm (PM2.5)

NC0.5
Number concentration of particulate matter. This differs from PM because NC gives the actual number of particles in the air. The raw NC is also classified by the particle size: < 0.5 µm (NC0.5); 0.5 µm < 1.0 µm (NC1.0); 1.0 µm < 2.5 µm (NC2.5);

Fire Alarm
ground truth is "1" if a fire is there
